 ##### You can probably see, that i mostly/only create Prototypes and nothing that is even near to being finished.  
 This can be explained, because if you start to finish something, you start to write MUCH more code, to make it more robust.
 I personally often even rewrite most, sometimes even all of my code.
 Currently i am working on a "simple" online Plattformer, which basically already works, but because i wanna finish it, i completly rewrote the whole clientside, and some of the serverside code.  I Should rewrite the whole serverside code, but i don't wanna, because it is absolutly not necessary. When i am mostly finished with it i will probably upload it to github.
